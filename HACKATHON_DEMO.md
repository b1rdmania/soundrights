# SoundRights - Hackathon Demo Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Overview
SoundRights is a Web3 music licensing platform that enables secure IP registration on Story Protocol blockchain with AI-powered audio analysis.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo Steps

### 1. Access the Platform
- Navigate to the deployed application
- Click "Story Demo" in the navigation

### 2. Upload & Register Track
- Upload any audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- Fill in track metadata (title, artist, genre)
- Click "Upload & Register IP on Blockchain"

### 3. Watch the Magic Happen
The platform will automatically:
- Analyze audio features (BPM, key, energy levels)
- Check for similar tracks in the database
- Register IP rights on Story Protocol blockchain
- Generate blockchain explorer URL for verification

### 4. View Results
- See audio analysis results (BPM, musical key, duration)
- Check IP registration status on blockchain
- Click "View on Story Protocol Explorer" to see blockchain transaction

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
