## Implementation Recommendation

Start with the team's "Demo Polish" milestone since it builds directly on our working integrations:

1. Enhance the existing verification flow display
2. Add sponsor branding to show real partnership value
3. Include blockchain explorer links for transparency
4. Add demo mode banner for user clarity

This approach leverages our strongest current capabilities (working Yakoa and Tomo integrations) while building toward the marketplace and analytics features the team prioritized.

The technical foundation supports all planned features effectively, and the build order aligns with demonstrating real sponsor integration value first, then expanding to full platform functionality.
