# SoundRights: Web3 Music IP Registration Platform
## Technical White Paper

### Executive Summary

SoundRights is a comprehensive Web3 platform designed specifically for independent record labels to manage music licensing and sync royalties. The platform provides blockchain-based IP registration through Story Protocol, enabling labels to establish verifiable ownership dates for future IP claims while offering dynamic licensing marketplace integration.

The platform bridges the gap between traditional music licensing and modern blockchain technology, allowing labels to bulk upload catalogs with automated pricing and sell licenses as NFTs through account abstraction - removing technical barriers for buyers.
