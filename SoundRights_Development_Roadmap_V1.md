*   **End of Week 6:** Licensee can discover, pay for (fiat), and receive a license and audio file. Core Story Protocol license link established.
*   **End of Week 8:** RH & Licensee dashboards are largely functional.
*   **End of Week 10:** Admin operational dashboard is providing key insights. Major bugs addressed.
*   **End of Week 12:** Platform deployed to production (V1 MVP Launch).

**Assumptions & Risks:**

*   **Lean Dev Team:** Assumes 2-3 experienced full-stack developers.
*   **Story Protocol SDK Stability:** Relies on the stability and usability of the chosen Story Protocol SDK. If Python bindings are not mature, a Node.js microservice adds complexity.
*   **Third-Party API Stability:** Gemini, Stripe, etc.
*   **Scope Creep:** V1 features are intentionally limited. Must resist adding non-essential features.
*   **Web3 Abstraction Complexity:** Ensuring seamless UX for fiat users interacting with on-chain elements requires careful backend design.
*   **Learning Curve:** Team familiarity with Story Protocol.

Regular sprint reviews, clear communication, and adaptability will be key to navigating this timeline.
