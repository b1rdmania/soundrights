## SoundRights Technical Specification & Deployment Plan

Prepared for Handover to Development Team

**Date:** July 23, 2024

### 1. Project Overview

SoundRights is a web3-native platform aimed at improving B2B music licensing through secure, transparent, and efficient processes. It leverages Story Protocol for on-chain IP management, AI for metadata, audio fingerprinting for verification, and partner integrations for streamlined workflows. The platform is designed for professional content creators, filmmakers, advertising agencies, and game developers.

### 2. Architecture

The system follows a microservice-oriented or layered architecture (based on the directory structure) with distinct components:

*   **Backend (FastAPI):** Serves the API, handles business logic, integrates with external services, and interacts with the database.
*   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores application data (Users, Tracks, Licenses, etc.).
*   **Cache/Broker (Redis):** Used for caching and potentially task queuing (Celery mentioned in Tech Stack).
*   **Blockchain (Story Protocol):** Manages on-chain IP assets and licenses.
*   **Frontend (React/TypeScript):** User interface for interacting with the backend API.
*   **External Services:** Various third-party APIs for specific functionalities (AI, Audio Recognition, Integrations).

### 3. Completed Work (as of README status)

Based on the Week 1 Progress Checklist:

*   **Project Setup:** Git repository, basic Docker configuration, initial CI/CD considerations.
*   **Dependency Management:** `requirements.txt` listing all Python dependencies.
*   **Local Environment:** `docker-compose` setup for Postgres, Redis, and pgAdmin. Automated setup script (`setup_dev.sh`).
*   **Configuration:** Core configuration (`app/core/config.py`), environment variable handling (`.env.example` mentioned as optional, `.env` auto-generated).
*   **Database Foundation:** Database layer setup (`app/core/database.py`), core models (`User`, `Track`, `License`, `APIKey`, mixins) defined.
*   **Security:** Utility functions for password hashing, JWT handling, and general authentication helpers.
*   **API Structure:** Main FastAPI application (`app/main.py`) with CORS, Sentry integration, logging, and a health check endpoint. Initial API router structure defined, specifically Auth endpoints (`register`, `login`, `refresh`, etc.) under `app/api/v1/endpoints/`.
*   **Database Migrations:** Alembic configured for database schema management.
*   **Documentation:** Initial versions of Roadmap, Whitepaper, and README created.
*   **Audio Identification:** Integrated AudD Music Recognition API (`app/services/audio_identification/audd_service.py`) to replace local fingerprinting. Endpoint `/api/v1/recognize/audio/audd` is implemented.

### 4. Remaining Work & Roadmap (V1)

Based on the Week 2 & Beyond list and Roadmap V1:

*   **Finalize Yakoa Integration:**
    *   Refine Pydantic models based on actual Yakoa API responses.
    *   Implement logic for generating public URLs for media files (presumably after upload, e.g., to S3).
    *   Integrate Yakoa `register_token` call within the audio upload workflow.
    *   Add database fields to store Yakoa `token_id` and status, and create the corresponding Alembic migration.
    *   Write comprehensive integration tests for the end-to-end Yakoa workflow.
*   **Implement Core Story Protocol Functionality:**
    *   Develop a dedicated service (`app/services/story_protocol/` or similar) for interacting with the Story Protocol SDK/API.
    *   Implement the function to register audio IP Assets on Story Protocol.
    *   Implement the function to attach licenses (PILs - Programmable IP Licenses) to registered IP Assets.
    *   Create corresponding API endpoints for these Story Protocol interactions (`/api/v1/ip/register`, `/api/v1/license/attach`, etc.).
*   **Integrate Tomo for User Onboarding:**
    *   Plan the integration of the Tomo SDK/API.
    *   Implement social login functionality via Tomo.
    *   Implement wallet management features facilitated by Tomo.
*   **Frontend Development (Initial Phase):**
    *   Build the user interface for registration and login, integrating with the Tomo backend implementation.
    *   Develop the UI for uploading audio files and inputting associated metadata.
    *   Create UI components to display track information, including status updates from Yakoa (originality check) and Story Protocol (IP/license registration).
*   **Database & Backend Polish:**
    *   Define and implement additional database models as required by new features (e.g., for detailed license terms, IP asset metadata, user profiles).
    *   Generate and apply necessary Alembic migrations for these new models and fields.
    *   Refine existing and implement new CRUD endpoints with complete business logic to support frontend features and integrations.
*   **Integrate Zapper for Analytics:**
    *   Utilize the Zapper Onchain analytics API to provide transparency and analytics on licenses and IP assets registered on-chain. This might involve querying blockchain data via Zapper's API and displaying it in the frontend or admin dashboard.
*   **Admin Dashboard:**
    *   Plan and begin development of an admin interface.
    *   Implement features to monitor system health, background job queues (Celery), and user activity.
*   **Testing & CI/CD:**
    *   Continuously expand automated test coverage for all new API endpoints, services, and core logic.
    *   Further develop and refine the CI/CD pipeline.

### 5. Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery (for background tasks).
*   **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Vite (build tool), Tailwind CSS (styling).
*   **Blockchain:** Story Protocol (Testnet currently).
*   **Audio:** AudD API (Music Recognition). Potential future use of other DBs like MusicBrainz, Discogs API.
*   **AI/Metadata:** Google Gemini.
*   **Integrations:** Tomo, Yakoa, Zapper.

### 6. Partner Integrations Specifics

*   **Tomo:** Used for user social login and wallet aggregation, streamlining the Web3 onboarding process.
*   **Yakoa:** Used for audio originality and authentication checks for all uploaded audio files.
*   **Zapper:** Used to provide on-chain analytics for IP assets and licenses, enhancing transparency.
*   **AudD:** Used for music recognition and identification via audio fingerprinting.

### 7. Testing & Development Practices

*   **Automated Testing:** A strong emphasis is placed on automated, detailed tests for all API endpoints and core services.
*   **Ongoing Debugging:** Continuous debugging is expected.
*   **Test Coverage Policy:** New endpoints or services should not be merged without corresponding tests.

### 8. Deployment Plan

The project includes several files relevant to deployment and environment setup:

*   `docker-compose.dev.yml`: Configuration for the local development environment (Postgres, Redis, pgAdmin).
*   `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the main application.
*   `gunicorn.conf.py`: Configuration for the Gunicorn WSGI server, used to run the FastAPI application.
*   `deploy.sh`: A placeholder or initial script for deployment. This will likely need significant expansion and refinement for production.
*   `.env.example`: Provides a template for required environment variables.
*   `.env.production`: Likely intended for production-specific environment variables.
*   `soundmatch.conf`: Might be a server configuration file (e.g., Nginx or Caddy), potentially for proxying to the Gunicorn application.
*   `vercel.json`: Configuration file for deployment on Vercel, likely for the frontend.

**Local Development Setup:**

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Run the automated setup script: `./setup_dev.sh` (This script is expected to handle `.env` generation and potentially other setup steps).
3.  Start the development environment using Docker Compose: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`.

**Production Deployment Considerations:**

*   The `Dockerfile` and `gunicorn.conf.py` provide the basis for running the application containerized.
*   `docker-compose.prod.yml` likely exists (though not explicitly listed in the project layout output, `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml` are mentioned in README) for orchestrating production services (app, database, redis).
*   The `deploy.sh` script needs to be completed to handle building, tagging, pushing images, and deploying to the chosen production environment (e.g., Kubernetes, a VPS with Docker Compose, etc.).
*   Environment variables must be securely managed in the production environment, using `.env.production` as a guide.
*   Consider using a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Caddy, potentially configured via `soundmatch.conf`) for SSL termination, static file serving, and potentially load balancing.
*   Monitoring (via Sentry, as integrated) and logging are configured.
*   CI/CD needs to be fully implemented to automate builds, testing, and deployments.
