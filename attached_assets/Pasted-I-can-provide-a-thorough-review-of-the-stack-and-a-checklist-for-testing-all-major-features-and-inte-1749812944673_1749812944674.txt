I can provide a thorough review of the stack and a checklist for testing all major features and integrations, but I do not have the ability to directly interact with your live production environment (e.g., click through the UI, connect wallets, or upload files). However, I can guide you through a comprehensive manual test plan and review the stack based on your codebase and deployment status.

---

## 1. **Stack Review**

### **Frontend**
- **Framework:** React.js (TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Routing:** wouter
- **State Management:** TanStack Query
- **Wallet Integration:** Reown WalletKit (400+ wallets, message signing)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Pages/Features:** Dramatic upload, marketplace, analytics, admin, profile, live demo

### **Backend**
- **Framework:** Express.js (TypeScript)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM)
- **Authentication:** Replit Auth (OpenID Connect, session management)
- **API Integrations:** Yakoa, Tomo, Story Protocol, Zapper, Reown
- **Security:** Middleware for route protection, session storage in PostgreSQL

### **DevOps/Deployment**
- **Environment Variables:** All required for production (see previous messages)
- **Database Migrations:** Drizzle ORM (`npm run db:push`)
- **Build:** Vite for frontend, Node for backend
- **Production Readiness:** Confirmed in your handover

## 2. **Comprehensive Manual Test Plan**

### **A. Wallet Integration (Reown WalletKit)**
- [ ] Connect with MetaMask, WalletConnect mobile, and at least one other wallet
- [ ] Sign a message and verify signature
- [ ] Disconnect and reconnect wallet
- [ ] Test wallet connection persistence (refresh, new session)

### **B. Sponsor Integrations**
- [ ] Yakoa: Upload a track, check originality/confidence score, verify token ID
- [ ] Tomo: Test social verification (demo and, if possible, real OAuth)
- [ ] Story Protocol: Register IP asset, check blockchain transaction hash, test on testnet
- [ ] Zapper: View portfolio, check NFT/DeFi data, verify creator credibility

### **C. Dramatic Upload Process**
- [ ] Go to `/live-demo`
- [ ] Upload a track, step through all 6 verification stages
- [ ] Confirm real-time feedback and sponsor branding
- [ ] Test fallback states (e.g., network timeout)

### **D. Marketplace & Licensing**
- [ ] List tracks, filter/search, view details
- [ ] Create and view licenses
- [ ] Purchase/license a track (if enabled)

### **E. Analytics & Admin**
- [ ] View analytics dashboard, check data visualizations
- [ ] Test admin panel: user management, activity logs, system monitoring
- [ ] Test admin filtering with large datasets

### **F. User Management**
- [ ] Register/login/logout
- [ ] View/edit profile
- [ ] GDPR compliance: request data, delete account

### **G. General UI/UX**
- [ ] Test on desktop, tablet, mobile
- [ ] Switch between dark/light mode
- [ ] Navigate all major pages
- [ ] Check for error messages and loading states

### **H. API Endpoints**
- [ ] `/api/yakoa/check-originality`
- [ ] `/api/tomo/test`
- [ ] `/api/sponsors/status`
- [ ] `/api/marketplace/licenses`
- [ ] `/api/auth/user`
- [ ] All CRUD for tracks, licenses, IP assets

### **I. Security & Session**
- [ ] Test session expiration and renewal
- [ ] Attempt unauthorized access to protected routes
- [ ] Check for secure cookie/session handling

---

## 3. **Known Issues to Watch For**
- TypeScript warnings in analytics/profile (should not block functionality)
- Admin dashboard query performance with large data
- Tomo OAuth is demo-mode unless fully enabled

---

## 4. **Automated Testing**
If you want to add automated tests:
- Use Jest/React Testing Library for frontend
- Use Supertest/Jest for backend API
- Add Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end flows

---

## 5. **Stack Recommendations**
- **Monitoring:** Add Sentry or similar for error tracking in production
- **Analytics:** Use PostHog, Plausible, or similar for user analytics
- **Performance:** Enable caching for heavy API endpoints if needed
- **Security:** Periodically review dependencies for vulnerabilities

---

## 6. **How to Proceed**
- Run through the manual test plan above in your production environment.
- If you want, I can help you write scripts for automated API or UI testing.
- Let me know if you want a deployment checklist for a specific cloud provider.
