I'll help you search through the codebase to understand the current state and requirements for integrating Reown WalletKit.

Let me search for relevant code first:

Based on the codebase search, I can see that your project is currently using RainbowKit for wallet connections, but you want to switch to Reown WalletKit. Let me help you understand what needs to be done.

Currently, your project has:
1. A `Web3Provider` component using RainbowKit
2. Wallet connection components and services
3. WalletConnect integration for transactions

To integrate Reown WalletKit, you'll need to:

1. First, install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm i @reown/walletkit @walletconnect/utils @walletconnect/core
```

2. Replace the current wallet connection implementation with Reown WalletKit. Here's what you'll need to modify:

```typescript:client/src/lib/web3Config.ts
// Replace the current RainbowKit config with Reown WalletKit
import { WalletKit } from '@reown/walletkit';

export const walletKit = new WalletKit({
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID || 'demo-project-id',
  chains: [sepolia, polygonMumbai],
  // Add any additional configuration options from Reown docs
});
```

```typescript:client/src/components/Web3Provider.tsx
import { WalletKitProvider } from '@reown/walletkit';

export function Web3Provider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <WalletKitProvider walletKit={walletKit}>
      {children}
    </WalletKitProvider>
  );
}
```

```typescript:client/src/components/WalletConnection.tsx
import { useWalletKit } from '@reown/walletkit';

export function WalletConnection({ onConnected, showStoryProtocolStatus = true }: WalletConnectionProps) {
  const { connect, disconnect, address, isConnected } = useWalletKit();
  
  // Rest of your component logic using Reown's hooks
  // ...
}
```

3. Update your environment variables:
```env
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

4. Update your server-side wallet connection service to use Reown's backend SDK if available.

The main benefits of switching to Reown WalletKit would be:
- Simplified wallet connection flow
- Built-in support for multiple chains
- Better TypeScript support
- More modern API design

However, before proceeding with the migration, I recommend:
1. Testing Reown WalletKit in a development environment first
2. Ensuring all your current wallet functionality (transactions, signing, etc.) is supported
3. Planning for a gradual migration to minimize disruption

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of the migration process?
