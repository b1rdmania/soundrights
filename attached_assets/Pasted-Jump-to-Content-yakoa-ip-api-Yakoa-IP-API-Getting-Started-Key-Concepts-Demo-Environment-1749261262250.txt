Getting Started

Yakoa’s API helps platforms authenticate digital content for intellectual property (IP) use — whether it’s infringing, authorized, or original. Designed for blockchains, marketplaces, and creative tools, this API gives you automated infrastructure for IP detection, rights validation, and downstream content protection.

You can use it to:

    Detect unauthorized reuse of brand-owned content
    Check if a creator or asset has prior authorization
    Flag original contributions so they’re protected against future infringement

What This API Does

When you register a digital asset (a “Token”), Yakoa evaluates it using AI-powered originality detection and a growing database of known IP, prior authorizations, and protected content.

This answers three critical questions:

    Is this asset infringing on existing IP?
    We check against all registered brand materials and previously flagged content.

    Has this use been authorized?
    If the creator or token is already approved by a brand, even if indirectly, that authorization is respected and recorded.

    What’s original here, and how should it be protected?
    The API flags novel contributions so they become part of the in-network reference set — allowing future infringements of this content to be caught automatically.


Core Entities

These are the main objects you’ll interact with:

    Brand: An external IP holder (e.g., a company or creator with known assets and rights)
    Creator: A user submitting content
    Token: A digital asset (image, video, or audio) with a provenance record (content credential or NFT)
    Authorization: A record of permission from an external Brand to your platform's content
    License: A record of permission from content on your platform
    Trust: A record of your own trust signals for the content on your platform

See Key Concepts for full definitions.
Typical Workflow

    Register Tokens: When new content is created:
    a. Register a Token with its metadata and media URLs, and add any known Authorizations or Licenses. b. The infringement check will start asynchronously
    Monitor Results:
    a. Check the infringements object in the response from the token GET endpoint b. In higher-volume use cases, set up a custom integration via web hook
    Allow for Updates:
    a. If the content evolves, the ownership changes, or a dispute gets raised, pass that information into the Yakoa system to keep your network up to date.
