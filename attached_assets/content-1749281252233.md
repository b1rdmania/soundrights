Yakoa’s API helps platforms authenticate digital content for intellectual property (IP) use — whether it’s infringing, authorized, or original. Designed for blockchains, marketplaces, and creative tools, this API gives you automated infrastructure for IP detection, rights validation, and downstream content protection.

You can use it to:

- Detect unauthorized reuse of brand-owned content
- Check if a creator or asset has prior authorization
- Flag original contributions so they’re protected against future infringement

## What This API Does   [Skip link to What This API Does](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/get-started\#what-this-api-does)

When you register a digital asset (a “Token”), Yakoa evaluates it using AI-powered originality detection and a growing database of known IP, prior authorizations, and protected content.

This answers three critical questions:

- **Is this asset infringing on existing IP?**


We check against all registered brand materials and previously flagged content.

- **Has this use been authorized?**


If the creator or token is already approved by a brand, even if indirectly, that authorization is respected and recorded.

- **What’s original here, and how should it be protected?**


The API flags novel contributions so they become part of the in-network reference set — allowing future infringements _of this content_ to be caught automatically.

## Core Entities   [Skip link to Core Entities](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/get-started\#core-entities)

These are the main objects you’ll interact with:

- **Brand**: An external IP holder (e.g., a company or creator with known assets and rights)
- **Creator**: A user submitting content
- **Token**: A digital asset (image, video, or audio) with a provenance record (content credential or NFT)
- **Authorization**: A record of permission from an external Brand to your platform's content
- **License**: A record of permission from content on your platform
- **Trust**: A record of your own trust signals for the content on your platform

See [Key Concepts](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts) for full definitions.

## Typical Workflow   [Skip link to Typical Workflow](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/get-started\#typical-workflow)

1. **Register Tokens:** When new content is created:


a. Register a Token with its metadata and media URLs, and add any known Authorizations or Licenses.
b. The infringement check will start asynchronously
2. **Monitor Results:**


a. Check the `infringements` object in the response from the token `GET` endpoint
b. In higher-volume use cases, set up a custom integration via web hook
3. **Allow for Updates:**


a. If the content evolves, the ownership changes, or a dispute gets raised, pass that information into the Yakoa system to keep your network up to date.
