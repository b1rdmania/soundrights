Here, we go over the core data models and entities you will interact with when using Yakoa's content autnentication API. Understanding these concepts is key to a seamless integration.

## Table of Contents   [Skip link to Table of Contents](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts\#table-of-contents)

- [Brand](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts#brand)
- [Creator](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts#creator)
- [Token](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts#token)
- [Authorization](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts#authorization)
- [License](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts#license)
- [Trust](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts#trust)

## Brand   [Skip link to Brand](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts\#brand)

**Purpose:** Represents an external IP owner (company, organization, or individual) from outside your platform. Brands are the basis against which Tokens are checked for infringement.

**Why it matters:** No network will contain all IP that could be infringed upon, so Yakoa also monitors for infringements against well known, public IP. Matches against this IP are flagged against Brand deemed to own the IP. These results are reported as `external_infringements` in the Token API, opposed to `in_network_infringements`, which are only checked against the content already registered in the network.

## Creator   [Skip link to Creator](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts\#creator)

**Purpose:** Represents an entity (often identified by a blockchain address or platform user ID) responsible for producing Tokens.

**Why it matters:** Tracks provenance of Tokens. Enables Brand-level authorizations for Creators, simplifying IP management for trusted partners, and prevents flagging multiple tokens created by the same Creator against each other.

## Token   [Skip link to Token](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts\#token)

**Purpose:** A tokenized media asset, which includes one or more media files (images, videos, audio) and provenance metadata (NFTs or content credentials). Each Token is checked for potential IP infringement.

**Why it matters:** This is the primary entity for IP analysis. The `media` URLs must be publicly accessible for checks to occur.

* * *

## Authorization   [Skip link to Authorization](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts\#authorization)

**Purpose:** A formal record indicating that a Brand has permitted a specific Creator or a specific Token to use its IP. This is crucial for distinguishing legitimate use from infringement.

**Why it matters:** Allows Brands to whitelist trusted Creators or specific content, reducing false positives and enabling collaborations.

* * *

## License   [Skip link to License](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts\#license)

**Purpose:** Represents a formal agreement or permission that grants a Token the right to use intellectual property from another Token (a "parent" Token).

**Why it matters:** Licenses allow for the creation of legitimate derivative works and complex IP relationships within networks. Declaring licenses helps the system understand these relationships and can influence infringement analysis (e.g., a Token might match a Brand's IP, but if it's licensed from an authorized parent Token that also derives from the Brand, it is not considered an infringement).

* * *

## Trust   [Skip link to Trust](https://docs.yakoa.io/reference/key-concepts\#trust)

**Purpose:** Allows a token's media to be marked as trusted. The currently available reasons for trust are:

- **Platform Trust:** The platform the media came is is trusted, meaning the media is not likely to infringe on any IP.
- **No Licenses:** The media has no licenses that can be obtained from it, reducing the damage of a potential infringement.

**Why is matters:** Trusted assets allow you to supplement Yakoa's checks with your own internal trust signals. This can bypass comprehensive infringement checking, but to still allow downstream infringements to be flagged against the trusted media.
